# EyeCursor
This project implements a hands-free cursor control system that uses real-time eye tracking to move the cursor based on eye movements. By leveraging OpenCV for video processing, Mediapipe for facial landmark detection, and PyAutoGUI for cursor manipulation, this solution provides an intuitive interface for hands-free computer interaction.
